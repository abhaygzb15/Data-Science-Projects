# Titanic Survival Prediction
![UI](https://github.com/abhaygzb15/Encryptix/assets/121966946/f18c00d9-1a09-4713-a7d3-2a7c807c5d0f)

## About
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict the likelihood of passenger survival from the RMS Titanic disaster of 1912, a tragedy that claimed over 1,500 lives. By analyzing historical passenger data, we uncover patterns and correlations that reveal who was more likely to survive and why. Leveraging data science techniques, we perform data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning to build accurate predictive models. This project highlights the importance of data-driven insights in understanding historical events and demonstrates the power of predictive modeling in real-world scenarios.
The project utilizes the Titanic dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset

## Features
1. Comprehensive Data Analysis: Explore the Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics and survival trends, including data cleaning and handling missing values.
2. Model Training: Utilize logistic regression to train predictive models on historical data, focusing on key features like age, gender, and class.
3. Interactive Prediction: Develop a Streamlit web application that allows users to input passenger details and receive real-time survival predictions.
4. Model Serialization: Serialize trained models into PKL files for easy deployment, preserving the model’s structure and parameters for consistent performance.
5. Data Visualization: Create visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate survival counts, demographics, and other relevant factors.

# Iris Flower Classification

## About
The Iris Flower Classification project aims to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. Iris classification is a classic machine learning problem where we train a model to identify the species of iris flowers based on a dataset containing the dimensions of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. There are three species of iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. Leveraging data science techniques, we perform data analysis, preprocessing, and model training to build accurate predictive models.
The project utilizes the Iris dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset

## Features
1. Comprehensive Data Analysis: Explore the Iris dataset to understand flower characteristics and species distribution, including data cleaning and handling missing values.
2. Model Training: Utilize logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, and random forest algorithms to train predictive models on historical data, focusing on key features like sepal and petal dimensions.
3. Interactive Prediction: Develop a Streamlit web application that allows users to input sepal and petal dimensions and receive real-time predictions about the species of the iris flower.
4. Model Serialization: Serialize trained models into PKL files for easy deployment, preserving the model’s structure and parameters for consistent performance.
5. Data Visualization: Create visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate species distribution, feature correlations, and other relevant factors.
