# Titanic Survival Prediction
# About
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict the likelihood of passenger survival from the RMS Titanic disaster of 1912, a tragedy that claimed over 1,500 lives. By analyzing historical passenger data, we uncover patterns and correlations that reveal who was more likely to survive and why. Leveraging data science techniques, we perform data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning to build accurate predictive models. This project highlights the importance of data-driven insights in understanding historical events and demonstrates the power of predictive modeling in real-world scenarios.
The project utilizes the Titanic dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset

# Features
1. Comprehensive Data Analysis: Explore the Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics and survival trends, including data cleaning and handling missing values.
2. Model Training: Utilize logistic regression to train predictive models on historical data, focusing on key features like age, gender, and class.
3. Interactive Prediction: Develop a Streamlit web application that allows users to input passenger details and receive real-time survival predictions.
4. Model Serialization: Serialize trained models into PKL files for easy deployment, preserving the modelâ€™s structure and parameters for consistent performance.
5. Data Visualization: Create visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate survival counts, demographics, and other relevant factors.
